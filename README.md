## Why This Project?

This project was born from genuine curiosity about modern web development and financial technology. Instead of following tutorials, I wanted to solve a real-world problem that would push me to learn **React** through hands-on experience with complex APIs and real-time data.

I chose banking services because the technical challenges fascinated me — OAuth flows, real-time data synchronization, and building secure user experiences around sensitive financial information. My goal was to create a meaningful portfolio piece and a deep learning experience in **API integration** and **full-stack development**.

## Core Functionality

- **Real-time Bank Integration** — Connect your account using TrueLayer's Open Banking API.
- **Account Overview** — View current balances and see financial progression over time.
- **Transaction Management** — Browse and filter all transactions with detailed views.
- **Recurring Payments** — Automatically track standing orders and direct debits.
- **Savings Goals** — Create, monitor, and track custom savings targets.
- 📊**Spending Analysis** — Visual breakdowns by category with month-over-month comparisons.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React (TypeScript)** — Type-safe, component-driven UI
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling
- **Recharts** — Interactive data visualizations

### Backend & Infrastructure

- **Supabase** — Auth and database (savings goals, bank connections)
- **Vercel** — Deployment and serverless function hosting
- **TrueLayer API** — Open banking integration for secure financial data

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Authentication Layer** — Supabase handles user sessions and sign-ins.
- **Data Layer** — A custom React Context (`DataContext`) manages all state and API calls.
- **API Layer** — Vercel serverless functions securely interface with the TrueLayer API.
- **UI Layer** — Built with TypeScript components and styled using Tailwind CSS.

---

## Security & Privacy

- **Open Banking Compliance** — Uses TrueLayer’s regulated infrastructure.
- **Token Security** — Access tokens stored securely via HTTP-only cookies.
- **No Data Storage** — Financial data is fetched in real time and not permanently stored.
- **Session Management** — Secure authentication with automatic session refresh handling.

---

## Current Limitations

- **Single Device Sessions** — Bank connections are limited to one device at a time due to session token restrictions.
- **Historical Data** — Limited by what the bank APIs return (often 90 days).
- **Transaction Categories** — Bank-provided categories are often vague (e.g. "PURCHASE", "ATM").
- **No Caching Yet** — Some views may load slowly due to live API calls.
- **Geographic Scope** — Only supports UK/European banks via TrueLayer.

## Note

This project was built purely for learning purposes. Since it hasn’t gone through TrueLayer’s full regulatory approval process, users may see a warning message when attempting to connect a bank account.
